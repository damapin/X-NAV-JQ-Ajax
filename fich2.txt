Come writers and critics<br>
Who prophesize with your pen<br>
And keep your eyes wide<br>
The chance won't come again<br>
And don't speak too soon<br>
For the wheel's still in spin<br>
And there's no telling who that it's naming<br>
For the loser now will be later to win<br>
Cause the times they are a-changing<br>
