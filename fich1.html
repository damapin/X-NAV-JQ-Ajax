<p>
Come gather around people<br>
Wherever you roam<br>
And admit that the waters<br>
Around you have grown<br>
And accept it that soon<br>
You'll be drenched to the bone<br>
And if your breath to you is worth saving<br>
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone<br>
For the times they are a-changing<br>
