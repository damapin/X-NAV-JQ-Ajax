Come senators, congressmen<br>
Please heed the call<br>
Don't stand in the doorway<br>
Don't block up the hall<br>
For he that gets hurt<br>
Will be he who has stalled<br>
There's the battle outside raging<br>
It'll soon…<br><br>
Come mothers and fathers<br>
Throughout the land<br>
And don't criticize<br>
What you can't understand<br>
Your sons and your daughters<br>
Are beyond your command<br>
Your old road is rapidly aging<br>
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand<br>
Cause the times they are a-changing<br><br>
The line it is drawn<br>
The curse it is cast<br>
The slowest now<br>
Will later be fast<br>
As the present now<br>
Will later be past<br>
The order is rapidly fading<br>
And the first one now will later be last<br>
Cause the times they are a-changing<br><br>
